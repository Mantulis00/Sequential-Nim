# Sequential-Nim
#TACS : 
1. the winner always takes the last pile, all of it.
2. If pile is more than 1, player if he wants to swap takes everything except 1 if he doesnt he takes all of it
3. If winning player is on winning row, it doesnt matter how loosing player plays.

Program:
Player starts as looser -> if the earlier pile has more than one and player is loosing he is able to swap
